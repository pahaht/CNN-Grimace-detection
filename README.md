# CNN-Grimace-detection
This repository enables grimace expression detection in images and videos using a trained 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It includes a pre-trained model and code for seamless integration.

### *Overview*
Grimace detection is crucial in various applications such as emotion recognition, healthcare,
and human-computer interaction. This repository provides a pre-trained CNN model for accurately detecting grimace expressions.

 ## Features 
-Detection of various grimace expressions including duckface, eyes closed, left eye blink, open mouth, right eye blink, and tongue out.
-Seamless integration with image and video data.
-Easy-to-use interface for running inference on custom data.


### *Dataset*
In this project, I used the Roboflow dataset
